Until Java 17, for plain old java objects (POJO), we needed to create a class with getters, setters, equals, hashcode and toString methods.

To avoid this boilerplate code, we used Lombok to generate the getters and setters.

In Java 17, we don't need this Lombok plugin. These classes can be created using Record classes.

A record class is nothing more than regular POJO, for which most of the code is generated from the definition



Java 8
public class Person) {
private final String name;
Person(String name) {
this.name name;
public void setName( String name) {
this.name = name;
public String getName() {
return name;

Java 17:
public record Person (String name){}


Key Points:

The above code written in Java 17 automatically generates getters, setters, equals, hashcode and toString methods.

In the record class, an all-args constructor is created automatically for all the record components declared. We can also write our own all-args constructor.

Record classes are final classes which cannot be extended or modified.

We cannot define our own instance variables inside the record class.










Creating a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class is a fundamental task in Java, and the approach has remained relatively stable from Java 8 to Java 17. However, newer features introduced in Java 14 and above can simplify and enhance POJO creation. Here's a comparison of creating a POJO class in Java 8 and Java 17:

### *Java 8*

In Java 8, a POJO class typically includes private fields, public getter and setter methods, a no-argument constructor, and optionally, a constructor with arguments, and toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods.

java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // No-argument constructor
    public Person() {}

    // Constructor with arguments
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getter and setter methods
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    // toString method
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + '}';
    }

    // equals method
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Person person = (Person) o;
        return age == person.age && Objects.equals(name, person.name);
    }

    // hashCode method
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age);
    }
}


### *Java 17*

In Java 17, you can leverage the record feature introduced in Java 14 to create a concise, immutable POJO. Records automatically generate the constructor, getter methods, toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods.

java
public record Person(String name, int age) {}


The record declaration is a significant improvement for creating simple data carrier classes, reducing boilerplate code and ensuring immutability by default.

### *Comparison*

1. *Boilerplate Reduction*:
   - *Java 8*: Requires manually writing constructors, getters, setters, toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods.
   - *Java 17*: Records automatically provide these methods, significantly reducing boilerplate code.

2. *Immutability*:
   - *Java 8*: Requires additional effort to make the class immutable (e.g., making fields final and omitting setters).
   - *Java 17*: Records are immutable by default.

3. *Syntax Simplicity*:
   - *Java 8*: More verbose and prone to errors in method implementations.
   - *Java 17*: More concise and less error-prone.

### Example Usage

*Java 8 POJO Usage*:
java
Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
person.setAge(31);
System.out.println(person.getName() + " is " + person.getAge() + " years old.");


*Java 17 Record Usage*:
java
Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
System.out.println(person.name() + " is " + person.age() + " years old.");


While the fundamental approach to creating a POJO remains consistent, Java 17's records offer a more streamlined and modern way to define simple data structures.
