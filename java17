*Exploring the Hidden Gems of Sakleshpur: A Journey Through Nature and History.*

Last month, I had the pleasure of embarking on a memorable trip to Sakleshpur, a serene hill station nestled in the Western Ghats. The journey was filled with breathtaking landscapes, rich history, and the warm hospitality of a coffee estate homestay. Here are some highlights from the trip:
Magajahalli (Habbi) Waterfalls: Our adventure began with a visit to the stunning Magajahalli Waterfalls, where the cascading waters offered a refreshing start to the day. The natural beauty and the sound of the waterfalls were simply mesmerizing.

Ride to Devaramane Hill Station: The ride to Devaramane was an exhilarating experience. The winding roads, lush greenery, and panoramic views of the Western Ghats made it a journey to remember.

Bettada Byraveshwara Temple: We took a spiritual detour to Bettada Byraveshwara Temple, an ancient temple nestled amidst the hills. The tranquility and the surrounding scenery provided a perfect setting for reflection and peace.

Star-shaped Manjarabad Fort: A visit to the star-shaped Manjarabad Fort was like stepping back in time. The fort's unique design and the panoramic view from the top were highlights of this historical site.

Estate Walk Through Coffee Plantations: Staying at a coffee estate homestay allowed us to take leisurely walks through lush coffee plantations. The aroma of coffee beans and the sight of green plantations were a treat for the senses.

Seasonal Waterfalls: The monsoon season revealed hidden gems in the form of seasonal waterfalls. These spontaneous waterfalls, flowing through the dense forests, added an element of surprise and delight to our exploration.

Belur Temple: A visit to the Belur Temple introduced us to the intricate Hoysala architecture. The detailed carvings and sculptures were a testament to the artistry and craftsmanship of the bygone era.

Hemavathi Backwaters and Floating Church: The serene Hemavathi Backwaters were a sight to behold. The floating church, partially submerged during the monsoons, added a unique and mystical charm to the landscape.

Sakleshpur offered a perfect blend of natural beauty, history, and culture, making it a destination worth exploring. This trip will remain etched in my memory as a journey of discovery and tranquility.
